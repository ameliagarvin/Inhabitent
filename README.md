# Inhabitent

Inhabitent is my first Wordpress theme as well as the first time developing using Wordpress. The project was made for a fictional brand named Inhabitent. It is a multiple page Wordpress website which allows a user to search through potentially buying products from the brand inhabitent. The website features an about page which tells the story of the inhabitent brand, a front-page which displays featured posts and journal pages which have brand stories in relation to the available products.

# What I learned

During this project I learned how to target specific pages using the built in wordpress classes. How to use PHP in relation to Wordpress, how to navigate through the Wordpress Dashboard. The challenges in this project were the amount of CSS to accomplish, hidden gotcha's such as the category and Tag pages and properly organizing CSS.
